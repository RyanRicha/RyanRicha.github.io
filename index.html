                    <strong>Dit gaat over mijn coding skills</strong><br><br> People ask me all the time — why do you
                    like
                    coding? Isn’t it really hard? Isn’t the work boring? Do you still have a social life?<br><br>

                    Today, I am going to share 5 reasons why I have stuck with coding and why I love it!<br><br>

                    1. You are always learning and challenging yourself! Whether you are learning a new programming
                    language, trying out a new framework, or trying to solve a problem with a new algorithm, you are
                    always stretching your mind. Now don’t get me wrong, the learning curve for coding is pretty steep.
                    However by letting yourself make those mistake and experience those failures, that is when you grow
                    the most. I’ve learned so much by overcoming the challenges that come with coding. Not only does
                    coding make you a better problem solver but it also teaches you patience, perseverance, and
                    discipline. Coding pushes you outside of your comfort zone in a good way!<br><br>

                    2. Problem solving can be relaxing. I know what you are thinking. Like Jasmine, how can you say
                    solving problems is relaxing?? When I get stuck on a problem, I want to tear my hair out! Don’t
                    worry, I feel you. In fact, I’ve been there many times myself.
                    However, my mindset completely shifted when I started approaching the problems and bugs I found
                    while coding from a curious perspective. Instead of talking down on myself and saying things like
                    why aren’t you smart enough, why can’t you figure this out, maybe this isn’t for you, I decided to
                    ask myself better questions. I found myself going to StackOverFlow, Google,
                    forums, TAs, and professors — and every single time, I would be able to solve that nasty bug or
                    memory leak or whatever I thought was impossible! It’s kind of like being a detective — going to
                    multiple sources, collecting information, and putting the pieces together. The feeling when you
                    finally figure it out is so rewarding!<br><br>

                    3. You get to work on exciting projects! What is cool about being a coder is that you have control
                    over how an application or website or whatever you create works! One of the first software
                    engineering projects I did was a bus app I made in one of my classes. I got to parse data from my
                    city’s transit system to build an app that tracks when buses arrive at each station. Another cool
                    project I created at a hackathon was an app to help match children looking for a adoption family to
                    families looking to adopt. I also created a Spotify for smoothies app at another hackathon. I also
                    created applications for large companies such as Nordstrom and Best Buy during my internships which
                    leads me to my next point:<br><br>

                    4. Code opens up opportunities for you. When I discovered coding when I was 13, I didn’t even know
                    it was coding. I was using HTML tags inside a game forum to embed images, links, and videos I
                    thought was cool. That lead me into learning web design and using HTML and CSS to create websites.
                    When I entered my first year of college, I landed my first digital design internship at Best Buy
                    Canada which was unusual for someone who just started their degree. What really helped me get the
                    position was knowing how to code in HTML and CSS, something not all designers knew. Then, I caught
                    the coding bug and went on to teach myself JavaScript, Ruby, Java, Python, etc. Combined with my
                    computer science classes, I was able to pass multiple coding interviews to land a software
                    engineering internship at Nordstrom. As a computer science student, I also got to travel to
                    different cities to attend programs and conferences hosted by companies. None of this would have
                    been possible if I did not know how to code and I am forever grateful for the endless opportunities
                    coding has given me.<br><br>

                    5. You get to be a part of a passionate community. Sure, most of the time, programming is an
                    individual activity. However, I’ve found my computer science classes to be some of the most
                    collaborative as well. When everyone is struggling and learning something new, people tend to
                    collaborate more with one another to figure out problems together. In the coding community, nobody
                    knows everything. There’s always a programming language, a new framework, a new API, or a new
                    problem to solve and everyone needs help sometimes. Most people I’ve met in the coding community
                    loves helping each other out. Whether that is your fellow classmates or professors or strangers on
                    StackOverflow, people want to help you figure things out. Plus, most people in technology are very
                    passionate about the things they have learned and are open to sharing. I have been able to meet so
                    many talented, hardworking, and intelligent people through coding. The community definitely makes
                    you feel less alone when you get another segmentation fault … cause guess what, we’ve all been there
                    before<br><br>

                    <strong>Dit gaat over mijn marketing skills</strong> <br><br>

                    4 thing to love about marketing <br><br>

                    1. Establish connections<br><br>

                    Marketing can increase the skills of your people. Marketing is about reaching the public and
                    connecting with consumers. There are several channels to do so, so you must be in tune with your
                    audience to make the right marketing decisions. Eventually, as he perfects his intuition and backs
                    it up with data, it will reach consumers effectively and drive them to take the desired
                    actions.<br><br>

                    Comparatively, when you work with your team to generate marketing ideas, you will be forming links
                    within the company. Collaboration between you and your colleagues is an important part of a
                    successful organization. Since marketing and sales teams foster prospects and close businesses, the
                    growth of a business depends on the combination of both. There is even a term for the integration of
                    marketing and sales: "marketing". While it can be difficult to unify these teams, it is beneficial
                    for a brand to incorporate marketing into the mix. 2. Results specified in data<br><br>

                    The numbers do not lie. If it is a social media campaign or paid advertising, you can use market
                    research to collect valuable data. These data give an idea of how you should structure your
                    strategy. For example, analytical data can determine which business segment focused on a particular
                    period of time. If a team needs more support than others during a quarter, it can refocus its
                    efforts to meet their needs. Analytical findings will explain the budget for marketing too. If it is
                    clear that your business is reaching consumers with a particular investment, it would be worth
                    continuing. If you enjoy numbers, you will love the unlimited amount of ways you can use the data in
                    marketing.<br><br>

                    3. Content Creation<br><br>

                    Writing never goes out of style. Creating genuine and compelling content can work wonders for your
                    business. Content that resonates with consumers can trigger certain emotions and form a link between
                    a brand and an individual. This kind of relationship will lead to prospective customers. Therefore,
                    it is worth practicing writing regularly to attract your audience, while improving your own writing
                    skills along the way. Try writing a blog or weekly newspaper for ten minutes every day. If you work
                    to improve your writing skills, you will soon realize that marketing becomes an easy process to
                    love.<br><br>

                    4. Design<br><br>

                    Marketing can wake your inner artist. There are always new designs to create, tools to use and ideas
                    to create. Creating visually appealing content is a great way to attract people who want to learn
                    more. This is profound if you design an attractive marketing campaign that generates new customers.
                    No matter how skilled you are in design, marketing explores your creative side. If you lack
                    creativity, there are many tools available for non-designers looking to improve their marketing
                    skills.<br><br>

                    Even the most traditional tools can update your marketing game. For example, color may resonate with
                    viewers. You can make a bold statement simply by incorporating certain colors into a digital ad or
                    an email campaign. By implementing a particular color scheme throughout your marketing content, you
                    can distinguish your brand from others in the industry and convey a purpose to your
                    audience.<br><br>
