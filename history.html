            <h1>
                Previous RT models, 1978 to 2005
            </h1>
            <p>
                BMW Motorrad began manufacturing RT (Reise-Tourer, or travel tourer) touring motorcycle models in the
                late 1970s. The first of these was air-cooled (or "airhead") models that continued BMW's long tradition
                dating to 1923 of producing "boxer" or opposed flat-twin engined motorcycles with unit
                engine-transmission construction and shaft-final-drive.

                In 1995, BMW produced its first air and oil-cooled (or "oilhead") RT model, the R1100RT. The new machine
                included standard ABS brakes, four-valve heads, five-speed gearbox, Telelever front suspension,
                Paralever rear suspension, and an electrically adjustable screen.

                In 2001, BMW launched the R1150RT, providing the same basic platform with increased engine capacity and
                horsepower, fully linked power-assisted ABS brakes, revised front lighting system, and a six-speed
                gearbox. This model was further updated in 2004 by the adoption of dual ignition, with two spark plugs
                per cylinder.

            <h2>
                2005 to 2013
            </h2>

            <p>
                "In 2005, BMW introduced the R1200RT. The design of this model was completely different from the
                R1150RT with a 15% boost in power, 20 kg (44 lb) weight saving,optional electronic suspension
                adjustment (ESA) and on-board computer. A low seat and/or a lowered suspension were available for
                shorter riders reducing seat height to a lowest level of 820 mm (32.3 in),although the lowered
                suspension eliminates the ESA option. The standard electrically operated windscreen was adjustable
                across a range of heights.

                The servo powered ABS brakes on the 2005 and 2006 models were partially integrated such that the rear
                brake pedal only applies the rear brake while the front brake lever applies both brakes. For the 2007
                model year, servo assist was removed from the partially integrated brakes. A new, more advanced and
                lighter ABS system was produced by Continental Teves, which also produced the optional Automatic
                Stability Control (ASC),in BMW's traction control system for motorcycles.

                An electronic tire pressure monitor (TPM) was introduced as an option. During the production of the 2006
                models, the original two-tone horns were replaced by a single-tone horn. Other optional equipment
                included cruise control, heated grips, heated seats for both the rider and passenger and a CD/Radio
                audio system.

                With 110 hp (82 kW) and 85 lbf⋅ft (115 N⋅m) of torque, the R1200RT is suitable for long-distance touring
                carrying a rider and passenger and a full load of luggage; and is able to reach 135 mph (217 km/h) and
                do a standing quarter mile in 12.2 seconds.

                In November 2009, BMW announced some revisions to the R1200RT for the 2010 model year. The new model had
                the same horsepower, but more torque at 88 lbf⋅ft (119 N⋅m), a higher engine speed of 8,500 rpm, and
                double overhead camshafts that were first used on the BMW HP2 Sport.

                There were some relatively minor styling changes and revisions to the screen and cockpit designs,
                switchgear (including conventional indicators), and location of the hydraulic fluid reservoirs."

            <h3>
                2014 to 2018
            </h3>
            <p>The 2014 model represented a wholesale redesign of the R1200RT. The biggest change was a shift to a water
                cooled version of the boxer engine, producing dyno tested 113.5 horsepower (84.6 kW) and 82.1
                pound-feet (111.3 N⋅m) torque. BMW claimed 125 horsepower and 92 lb/ft of torque with their own
                testing methodology.The seat and seating position, fairing, instrumentation, and frame were also
                updated. The standard ride modes "Rain" and "Road" can also be activated at the press of a button to
                adapt to weather conditions and road surfaces. An on-board computer, an electrically operated
                windshield, standard color-matched saddle bags, and heated grips were also basic items.

                Optional equipment for the 2014 RT includes semi-active electronic suspension adjustment, and BMW
                Dynamic ESA, which response to changing road surfaces, and a shift assistant pro that allows the rider
                to shift up and down without using the clutch or throttle. A central locking system locks both cases by
                remote control. Other options are a radio, a top case, low or high saddles, a tank bag, cruise control,
                and (introduced for the 2015 model) keyless ignition and locking
